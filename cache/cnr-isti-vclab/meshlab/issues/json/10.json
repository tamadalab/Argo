After the .stl loaded into meshlab, the screen went black, I used a force shut down and tried to reboot and the screen came on for a few seconds with multi colored random lines across it, so force shut down again. Now all it does is chime when powered on and only has a black screen. Things I've tried are: PRAM/NVRAM/SMC reset, safe/recovery mode boot, power-s key-force shut down sequence but nothing has worked. Any ideas about next steps?",
